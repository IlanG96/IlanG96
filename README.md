# Hi, I'm Ilan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year computer science student with a passion for software development, machine learning, and data science. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to learn and improve my skills, and I'm excited to explore new technologies and ideas.

As a full-stack software developer, I love building web applications with JavaScript, React, and Node.js, as well as using other cool libraries and frameworks. I'm constantly looking for ways to expand my knowledge and expertise in these areas, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges.
